After finding your summoner, the application will display the profil page of your summoner with his ranking achievement (if he's not an ARAM one trick poney). You can switch between each page using the tabs or you can go back to the main page with the arrow on the top left of the screen.

The history page allows you to browse your last 10 matchs on League of legends. You can view details such as your score or your KDA. If you want to display your opponents or the build you used you must click on the blue arrow at the bottom of the match's card.

The best champions page is there to show you your 10 most played champions in ranked. You can scroll down to see all of your heroes !
### For devs
If you want to use the code to build the application in your IDE such as Android Studio you must add your own API KEY in the AndroidManifest.xml file at the line 16.
```xml
<meta-data
            android:name="corentin.lol.api.API_KEY"
            android:value="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY" />
```
